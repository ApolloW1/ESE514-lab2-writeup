## 3.2: Response to Questions
Why is bit-banging impractical on your laptop, despite it having a much faster processor than the RP2040?

What are some cases where directly using the GPIO might be a better choice than using the PIO hardware?

How do you get data into a PIO state machine?

How do you get data out of a PIO state machine?

How do you program a PIO state machine?

In the example, which low-level C SDK function is directly
responsible for telling the PIO to set the LED to a new color? How
is this function accessed from the main “application” code?

What role does the pioasm “assembler” play in the example, and
how does this interact with CMake?
